## Bundle configuration

No configuration is required, but there's one possible configuration:

```javascript
{
  "selectionTools" : true
}
```

Setting selectionTools to true will add a new button to toolbar that opens a selection tool dialog. Using selection tools the user can select features by drawing point or area. Features that are inside or intersect the drawn area are selected.
